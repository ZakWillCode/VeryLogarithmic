# VeryLogarithmic
A sample of the Verilog project I put together, all coding done by me.

Attached is all Verilog files used to create an ALU with:
Add, Mult, Shift, and XNOR functions
Each of these functions was testing with it's own independent test bench. 
Then brought together with an added display for FPGA functionality.
A sync block was constructed but was found not to be necessary for this application.
This was finally tested using an overall testbench for final accuracy. 

A report PDF is attached.
