# VeryLogarithmic
A sample of the Verilog project I put together, all coding done by me.

Attached is all Verilog files used to create an ALU with:
Add, Mult, Shift, and XNOR functions
Each of these functions was testing with it's own independent test bench. 
Then brought together with an added sync and display for FPGA functionality.
This was finally tested using an overall testbench for final accuracy. 

A report PDF is attached.
